Matreshka - is a small and powerful client-side JavaScript framework that allows you to build single page applications as simply as possible.

* Two-way data-bindings in JavaScript files. No more {{weird.syntax}} inside HTML.
* It's simple. Really. You don't need to learn mass of articles to get started.
* Custom architecture. You can choose any way how you build an application.

## [Release History](https://github.com/finom/matreshka/releases)

## Todo
* Fire ``remove`` and ``modify`` when data key is removed from ``Matreshka.Object`` instance (``remove``, ``removeDataKeys``)
* ``force`` flag for ``Matreshka.Array`` events
* ``Matreshka#off`` for delegated DOM events with specified selector
* Refactor ``Matreshka#_on`` and ``Matreshka#_off`` methods
* Remove event after handler call in ``Matreshka#once``
* ``binder.destroy`` member that calls when ``Matreshka#unbindNode`` is called
* ``private`` global event flag that makes event to be silent for delegated handlers
* Fire ``remove`` event on data remove for ``Matreshka.Object``
* Export Matreshka using ES6 syntax


**Maybe will be added in next versions**
* ``Matreshka.toMatreshka`` - converts JS object to Matreshka instance
* Some way to get parents from delegated Matreshka events
* ``toJSONString`` method
* ``bindSandbox`` method which accepts single argument + event options
* ``this.bound.key`` instead of ``this.bound('key')`` as alternative
